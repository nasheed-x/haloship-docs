Welcome to Haloship's documentation!
===================================

**Haloship** is a high-powered rocket built with no external screws, shear-pins, or epoxy. Its internal substructures feature fully mechanical assemblies, while at its core lies a mechanically and electronically redundant parachute release system, termed the Hold Down & Release Mechanism (HDRM). The rocket also features an array of custom Student Research and developed avionics, including a custom flight computer and high-speed data acquisition payload. As nyuad.space's entry to the 2023 Spaceport America Cup, Haloship aimed to demonstrate innovative new possibilities in the realm of high-powered rocketry and successfully completed its test flight on June 24th, 2023. It secured 2nd place for the Dr. Gil Moore Award for Innovation.
